This mod adds a few very useful recipes.
 Check the Recipe Browser to figure them all out.

Also adds some OP accessories (with complicated recipes) which can really super-charge the Player.
To balance out how powerful these accessories are, I gave them recipes that require massive amounts of money.

Use the Recipe Browser to figure them all out.

The current accessories (sorted by cost) include:
> Build Range Pixel (Massively increases block placement range. Splelunker buff. Adds Platinum Watch buff. Immune to Blackout, Darkness, Obstructed and NoBuilding debuffs)

> Melee Pixel (Massively increases melee weapon speed, crit, and damage. No Knockback. Immune to Withered Weapon debuff. Infinite Night Vision and Hunter buff.)
> Range Pixel (Massively increases range weapon crit and damage. Immune to Confused and Cursed debuffs.)
> Magic Pixel (Massively increases magic weapon crit, damage. All magic needs 0 mana. Massively increases mana and mana regen. Star Cloak buff. Immune to Mana Sickness, and Silenced debuffs.)

> Ice Pixel (Ice Skate and Tiger Climbing Gear abilities. Immune to Chilled, Frozen, and Frostburn debuffs)
> Jump Pixel (Increases player speed and jump height. Immune to Slow, Weak, OgreSpit, and Webbed debuffs. Adds Compass and Depth Meter buffs.)
> Minion Pixel (Increases number of minions slots by 20. Massively increases minion damage. Immune to BrokenArmor and WitheredArmor debuff)

> Floating Pixel (No fall damage. Infinite Magic Carpet. Immune to Stoned debuff)

> Fire Pixel (Let's you walk on water, lava, and fireblocks. Take no damage from lava. Immune to Burning, OnFire, and Cursed Inferno debuffs)

> Life Pixel (Massively increases HP, regeneration, and defense. Immune to Venom, Poisoned, and Bleeding debuff.)

NOTE
This mod is the continuation of OP + Recipes. The original mod suddenly stopped compiling correctly so I copied all the code to this mod and republished.

GOALS
I NEED LOTS OF HELP! I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE THE IDEAS I HAVE!!

I'd like to add tools that do interesting things too. Like axes that can cut down 2 trees at once? Picks that mine a 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 area?
