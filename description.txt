This mod adds some very useful, only slightly cheaty, recipes!

There's boomerangs, fishing bait, and dual-use swords!

Also adds some OP accessories which can really super-charge the Player.

Use the Recipe Browser to figure them all out. Read all about the stuff in the mod on the mod homepage.

CHANGELOG
v1.0.0 - "You really need to work on the icons." / "Okay. How about now?" / "Well, it's not worse..."
Icons provided under the Creative Commons 3.0. Many thanks to Lorc for providing these icons at game-icons.net

v1.5.2 - Convert wood into copper ore. Then convert copper ore into successive tiers of stronger ore. Each tier costs 2x as much as the previous tier.
