This mod adds a few very useful recipes.
 Check the Recipe Browser to figure them all out.

New Items Added: Gel Bait (pun completely intended) which is crafted using 10 Gel.

Also adds some OP accessories (with complicated recipes) which can really super-charge the Player.
To balance out how powerful these accessories are, I gave them recipes that require massive amounts of money.

Use the Recipe Browser to figure them all out.

The current accessories (sorted by cost) include:
> Build Range Pixel (Massively increases block placement range. Splelunker buff. Adds Platinum Watch buff. Immune to Blackout, Darkness, Obstructed and NoBuilding debuffs)
> Water Pixel (No breath timer underwater. Allows swimming. Allows you to walk on water, but NOT lava. Massively boosts fishing.)

> Magic Pixel (Massively increases magic weapon crit, damage. All magic needs 0 mana. Massively increases mana and mana regen. Star Cloak buff. Immune to Mana Sickness, and Silenced debuffs.)

Melee Pixel, Range Pixel, and Magic Pixel also provide Infinite Night Vision and Hunter buff.

GOALS
I NEED LOTS OF HELP! I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE THE IDEAS I HAVE!!

I'd like to add tools that do interesting things too. Like axes that can cut down 2 trees at once? Picks that mine a 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 area?

CHANGELOG
v1.0.0 - "You really need to work on the icons." / "Okay. How about now?" / "Well, it's not worse..."
Icons provided under the Creative Commons 3.0. Many thanks to Lorc for providing these icons at game-icons.net

v1.1 - Realized that the pixels were too expensive, so I reduced the price of the Water Pixel so you can grind fishing to get money for the others.

v1.2 - Added Gel Bait
