This mod adds some very useful, only slightly cheaty, recipes! Now supports alternate ores as well.

There's boomerangs, fishing bait, and dual-use swords!

Also adds some OP accessories called Pixels which can really super-charge the Player.

Use the Recipe Browser to figure them all out. Read all about the stuff in the mod on the mod homepage.

CHANGELOG
v1.0.0 - "You really need to work on the icons." / "Okay. How about now?" / "Well, it's not worse..."
Icons provided under the Creative Commons 3.0. Many thanks to Lorc for providing these icons at game-icons.net

v1.6 - Boomerangs ignore tiles and can be fired through walls and blocks.

v1.7 - The Pixels are so OP, there's really no point in trying to balance them by giving them ridiculously expensive recipes, so now all the Pixel recipes can be crafted with 1 Platinum Coin. You are responsible for controlling yourself if you don't like using OP things.
